### Background and Inspiration

This summer, as I sat down in front of my laptop, I was daydreaming about my favorite vacation spots. While a huge travel advocate, I haven't really had the chance to explore the world. Because visiting different countries and navigating through their diverse cultures are big bucket-list items for me, I decided to create a travel website that could highlight these dreams in a user-interactable, visually beautiful manner.

### Details and Features

- Technologies used: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Animations when scrolling.
- Smooth scrolling throughout each section.
- Had different screen sizes in mind. Is mobile-friendly.

### Notes

To fine-tune my inventory of frontend development skills, I solely dedicated this project to just that: frontend development. As a result, there is no backend integration that I built for this project. I like to think of this website as a boiler plate for how I would like to build my future websites in terms of its aesthetic.
